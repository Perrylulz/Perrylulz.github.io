          <h2>The Best Album Ever (That's not Alice in Chains)</h2>
  
          <div class="indented-paragraph">
            <p>
              Obviously if you haven’t noticed I like Alice in chains…. Like a
              whole lot. 24/7 plug day in day out off the charts stan whatever u
              wanna say but point is Alice in Chains has always been my top 1 band
              and top 3 albums (I was in the top 0.01% listeners on spotify last
              year too). Recently though these albums have taken the back row
              seats to my new very much liked (maybe favorite maybe not) band:
              Linkin Park.

          <div class="indented-paragraph">

              Previously my iPods storage space was taken up by like 70% Alice in
              Chains but now the other 15% is taken up by Linkin Park and some
              other nu metal bands (Evanescence, Flyleaf). I had Hybrid Theory
              around but once my aunt got me Meteora, Alice is having to share
              some airtime with these albums.
            </p>

          <div class="indented-paragraph">

              This is mostly about Meteora, Hybrid Theory was an insane debut but
              Meteora really has a little bit more depth and the vocals really
              flow with every other sound like laminar flow. There’s so much
              movement in the songs, the samples and drum tracks really induce a
              groove and the lyrics are so singable. I’m listening to Easier to
              Run right now, the song really talks about emotional topics and you
              can really tell Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda have some hard
              hitting emotional grounds and they express it through music so well
              it's groundbreaking to listen to. Sitting and hearing everything
              together made me question music and its form a little. The
              instrumentala are so likable too, Brad Delson has some really
              interesting riffs. The album would be missing something if it
              weren’t for the guitar, the tones are so trademark of the band and
              it's really consistent but innovative across the tracks at the same
              time. All of the chords make each song resonate with something
              specific and with the lyrics it really takes you on a journey.

              So yeah, I think it's refreshing to have found another album that is
              so emotionally touching yet so listenable at the same time.
              Definitely feel connected to this album, plus the CD inlay has
              really cool pictures. My new Alice CDs don’t have really cool inlays
              but they're also new and I think my aunt got me an OG CD from a
              while ago so take that however :p I think this is a 10/10 album,
              wish it lasts longer but it's so replayable, recommend.
