              After posting my CS project I had to face what my bad html skills... I am the kind of person to see something very messy and disorganized and be compelled from the depths of my spirit to fix it.

              So! I have completely restructured my blog, the posts used to all be on one page in chronological order, but now there is an index and each blog gets its own webpage. I added a comments section to all of them but none of them work and I have to fix them ToT. Im thinking of adding something cooler and more 'news'-y, like a periodic update on the album I'm listening to at that time.

              Also Unfortunately, whenever I start a large project like this, it's all I want to do, I can't focus on anything else, and I sometimes become so passionate and dedicated, I neglect other things. xd

     At any rate, I am also still deeply absorbed in Astrology. The recent Venus retrograde has interfered with my relationships, I thought 'oh I hope <i>this</i> person will reach out to me again.' <i>No</i>, a person who I had entirely forgotten about, whom I recall vividly as I used to know him well, found me and we have been in contact since. It was definetly just random, but it happened. Sadly, though, I think I won't ever see this other person for maybe ever. I think I have developed this mentality that nothing happens for no reason because of this Venus retrograde. Also this <i>Mercury</i> retrograde has mentally been on the less excruciating side but my schedule has been so packed its still pretty exhausting. My mood has been lower but this is not a diary so thats all. lol
