            My Most Personally Influential Aspect - My Sun/Saturn Sextile (and stuff on 12 house merc)
          </h2>
  
          <div class="indented-paragraph">
            <p>  
              I thought a cool blog prompt would be to write about the aspect I feel has significantly affected me. I can't really say which one has affected me the *most* because there are some things I am not aware of.
            </p>

              Obviously I am proud of this not only because it involves my Sun but because It makes me feel strong. I feel like I have my backup person on the inside to be called upon whenever. Say, for instance, that I felt a certain different way about something than most of the people around me, I would remember that Sun/Saturn energy and something tells me that I am solid enough to do my own thing. Learning and growing I become more mentally and sensually aware, I have begun to feel things almost literally in my heart. I poke my chest sometimes, its like an itch.

              The solidness that I feel in my body, grounded when I stand, I can see myself by means of my minds eye. I think I might take an excerpt from my journal just for fun lol. You guys can see what's going on.

              I think whenever I try to write about my aspects I have this burst of energy but then it sputters out into nothingness because I actually haven't thought super hard about what's going on (I know I just wrote about the aspect but I've literally been sitting here for 5 minutes trying to write more). I guess on that note I could speak about my mercury placement. As it in the 12th house (the worst house) I have zero conscious, aware, vivid thoughts. One time I looked at a clock really hard to try and tell the time but I didn't even read the clock, I just sensed the vibe and then was like 'ok, I guess I have like 10 minutes of lunch left' *but no* it was like 20. I was so confused why the bell wasn't ringing.

              Anyways ya, people say I'm a very good writer, I really can't disagree, but I really wonder how that could be when my mercury seems so debilitated. I'll say it was my older brother, I don't think I've told him this story but one time we were in the same English class and he wrote an essay that I bothered him about where he let me read it and I swear my eyes popped out of my head. I was reading it and it was so good, it was rich and looked like it was actually trying to say something. I wonder how he got so good at essays. Anyways that one moment of a menial day changed me forever. I remember standing like young people do when they have a sudden expansion of their consciousness. that 0-0 look.

              I think the Saturn accept has strengthened my individuality, maybe I wouldn't feel like doing astrology if I didn't have that aspect. I know someone born a day before me and we have a similar look. Similar smile.

            so basically this has been a stream of consciousness, as all my blogs are. I never plan, never do drafts, literally just write and then boom, blogged.

              I think I like blogging because I like to share myself with the world. People suck tho atp in life, I get to get the most bang for my 1st amendment bucks on the internet.
