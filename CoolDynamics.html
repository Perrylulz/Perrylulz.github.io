            Cool dynamics between Scorpio and Aries
          </h2>
  
          <div class="indented-paragraph">
            <p>
              <em>So!</em> I was reading a friends chart and it opened me up to
              some very interesting dynamics between the signs of Scorpio and
              Aries. As one might know, traditionally Scorpio was ruled by Mars as
              well as Pluto but today, its been dropped per se. Now, Mars rules
              Aries alone.
            </p>
          </div>
  
          <div class="indented-paragraph">
            <p>
              There are important and obvious similarities between the two signs,
              both being unconditionally driven and strong willed, yet there are
              still interesting distinctions to be made and I just wanted to
              highlight my interpretation of the two signs.
            </p>

          <div class="indented-paragraph">

              The planet Pluto is representative in this context of worldy power
              such as money influence etc. It <em>can</em> mean other things but
              this worldly power aspect is what I will be referring to here, and
              the Sun represents the pure, strong energy that is detatched from
              the physical realm.
            </p>
          </div>
  
          <div class="indented-paragraph">
            <p>
              To start, I'll outline some obvious diferences. Scorpio is a water
              sign as opposed to Aries which is a fire sign. An element influences
              the general charicteristics of the person; water giving a deep and
              emotional side, and fire giving an assertive and enthusiastic aura.
            </p>
          </div>
  
          <div class="indented-paragraph">
            <p>
              So, we can do some math and say a watery sign that is ruled by Pluto
              would be deep, emotional, and crave power and influence.
              <em>But</em> if we add in Mars, which <em>still</em> makes sense for
              Scorpio today, we get drive, passion, and huge big motivation,
              traits scorpios are also very much known for.
            </p>
          </div>
  
          <div class="indented-paragraph">
            <p>
              With Aries we get the same deal, an embodiment of passion, willpower
              etc. I like to think the sign Aries is ruled in part by the Sun
              (,or,<em></em> the Sun has a lot of influence on Aries) due to the
              way the sign expresses itself; Aries has more of a light positive
              presence. They are always radiating energy as opposed to scorpio
              which emanates; doesn't necesarily radiate. With the two signs, they
              almost represent two different sides of strong people but with
              almost the same underlying motivator<em
                >(Mars being the motivation planet(Mars ruling both planets)).</em
              >Aries is the outward energetic leader, when you're around an Aries
              there isn't necesarily an underlying theme of darkness. Whereas with
              Scorpio leadership qualities typically are in a dark mysterious
              form(reflecting Pluto).
            </p>
          </div>
  
          <div class="indented-paragraph">
            <p>
              This can be applied anywhere, with the Sun/ Ascendant signs its more
              of what the person is portraying i.e. looks, social styles etc., but
              in aspects is where things
              <em>(especially with these planets)</em> get <em>joosy.</em>
            </p>
          </div>
  
          <div class="indented-paragraph">
            <p>
              With Mars, aspects typically grant almost endless positive energy to
              complete tasks, palpable passion, ambition, or even adds a sexual
              nature to a relationship(betewen the two planets involved). Mars can
              also add aggression, tension, and defiance to the mix. Pluto aspects
              supply determination and strength but also sometimes a natural
              talent, complete understadning of a goal, and give an intense
              nature, but also sometimes a power struggle, and a need to prove
              oneself. A trine between these two planets will allow the energies
              to blend smoothly and almost create a unique form of positive
              influence. A sextile might let the planets show their individual
              influences together as one united vibration. A square could
              exacerbate both of the planets sense of determination and strive,
              and an opposition can cause tension between the two planets,
              fighting for the center stage and always being at odds.

              <em>So,</em> I enjoy looking for Mars Pluto dynamics in a chart as
              it always adds a little bit of spice to the reading. These two
              planets are very strong together and have forefront levels of
              energies depending on a chart. ok long post ik lol so ya
