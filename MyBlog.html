            I have some new photos up, check them out! It's a small album with 
            photos taken of a huge blood moon over the Boston Logan Airport. I got cool effects with the window I shot from,
            which is what the "extra" moons are, just some cool reflections. I don't know if I 
            should start posting the raw images but you can get to the album quickly with

        <h2 class="indented-paragraph">The Best Album Ever (That's not Alice in Chains)</h2>

        <div class="indented-paragraph">
          <p>
            Obviously if you haven’t noticed I like Alice in chains…. Like a
            whole lot. 24/7 plug day in day out off the charts stan whatever u
            wanna say but point is Alice in Chains has always been my top 1 band
            and top 3 albums (I was in the top 0.01% listeners on spotify last
            year too). Recently though these albums have taken the back row
            seats to my new very much liked (maybe favorite maybe not) band:
            Linkin Park.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="indented-paragraph">
          <p>
            Previously my iPods storage space was taken up by like 70% Alice in
            Chains but now the other 15% is taken up by Linkin Park and some
            other nu metal bands (Evanescence, Flyleaf). I had Hybrid Theory
            around but once my aunt got me Meteora, Alice is having to share
            some airtime with these albums.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="indented-paragraph">
          <p>
            This is mostly about Meteora, Hybrid Theory was an insane debut but
            Meteora really has a little bit more depth and the vocals really
            flow with every other sound like laminar flow. There’s so much
            movement in the songs, the samples and drum tracks really induce a
            groove and the lyrics are so singable. I’m listening to Easier to
            Run right now, the song really talks about emotional topics and you
            can really tell Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda have some hard
            hitting emotional grounds and they express it through music so well
            it's groundbreaking to listen to. Sitting and hearing everything
            together made me question music and its form a little. The
            instrumentala are so likable too, Brad Delson has some really
            interesting riffs. The album would be missing something if it
            weren’t for the guitar, the tones are so trademark of the band and
            it's really consistent but innovative across the tracks at the same
            time. All of the chords make each song resonate with something
            specific and with the lyrics it really takes you on a journey.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="indented-paragraph">
          <p>
            So yeah, I think it's refreshing to have found another album that is
            so emotionally touching yet so listenable at the same time.
            Definitely feel connected to this album, plus the CD inlay has
            really cool pictures. My new Alice CDs don’t have really cool inlays
            but they're also new and I think my aunt got me an OG CD from a
            while ago so take that however :p I think this is a 10/10 album,
            wish it lasts longer but it's so replayable, recommend.

        <h2 class="indented-paragraph">Cool dynamics between Scorpio and Aries</h2>

        <div class="indented-paragraph">
          <p>
            <em>So!</em> I was reading a friends chart and it opened me up to
            some very interesting dynamics between the signs of Scorpio and
            Aries. As one might know, traditionally Scorpio was ruled by Mars as
            well as Pluto but today, its been dropped per se. Now, Mars rules
            Aries alone.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="indented-paragraph">
          <p>
            There are important and obvious similarities between the two signs,
            both being unconditionally driven and strong willed, yet there are
            still interesting distinctions to be made and I just wanted to
            highlight my interpretation of the two signs.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="indented-paragraph">
          <p>
            The planet Pluto is representative in this context of worldy power
            such as money influence etc. It <em>can</em> mean other things but
            this worldly power aspect is what I will be referring to here, and
            the Sun represents the pure, strong energy that is detatched from
            the physical realm.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="indented-paragraph">
          <p>
            To start, I'll outline some obvious diferences. Scorpio is a water
            sign as opposed to Aries which is a fire sign. An element influences
            the general charicteristics of the person; water giving a deep and
            emotional side, and fire giving an assertive and enthusiastic aura.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="indented-paragraph">
          <p>
            So, we can do some math and say a watery sign that is ruled by Pluto
            would be deep, emotional, and crave power and influence.
            <em>But</em> if we add in Mars, which <em>still</em> makes sense for
            Scorpio today, we get drive, passion, and huge big motivation,
            traits scorpios are also very much known for.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="indented-paragraph">
          <p>
            With Aries we get the same deal, an embodiment of passion, willpower
            etc. I like to think the sign Aries is ruled in part by the Sun
            (,or,<em></em> the Sun has a lot of influence on Aries) due to the
            way the sign expresses itself; Aries has more of a light positive
            presence. They are always radiating energy as opposed to scorpio
            which emanates; doesn't necesarily radiate. With the two signs, they
            almost represent two different sides of strong people but with
            almost the same underlying motivator<em
              >(Mars being the motivation planet(Mars ruling both planets)).</em
            >Aries is the outward energetic leader, when you're around an Aries
            there isn't necesarily an underlying theme of darkness. Whereas with
            Scorpio leadership qualities typically are in a dark mysterious
            form(reflecting Pluto).
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="indented-paragraph">
          <p>
            This can be applied anywhere, with the Sun/ Ascendant signs its more
            of what the person is portraying i.e. looks, social styles etc., but
            in aspects is where things
            <em>(especially with these planets)</em> get <em>joosy.</em>
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="indented-paragraph">
          <p>
            With Mars, aspects typically grant almost endless positive energy to
            complete tasks, palpable passion, ambition, or even adds a sexual
            nature to a relationship(betewen the two planets involved). Mars can
            also add aggression, tension, and defiance to the mix. Pluto aspects
            supply determination and strength but also sometimes a natural
            talent, complete understadning of a goal, and give an intense
            nature, but also sometimes a power struggle, and a need to prove
            oneself. A trine between these two planets will allow the energies
            to blend smoothly and almost create a unique form of positive
            influence. A sextile might let the planets show their individual
            influences together as one united vibration. A square could
            exacerbate both of the planets sense of determination and strive,
            and an opposition can cause tension between the two planets,
            fighting for the center stage and always being at odds.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="indented-paragraph">
          <p>
            <em>So,</em> I enjoy looking for Mars Pluto dynamics in a chart as
            it always adds a little bit of spice to the reading. These two
            planets are very strong together and have forefront levels of
            energies depending on a chart. ok long post ik lol so ya

            This was the amp that came home with me along with my first electric

            been having one hell of a time using it. It's another one of those

        <h2 class="indented-paragraph">What is Brutalism?</h2>

        <div class="text-and-image">
          <p class="indented-paragraph">
            Brutalism is an architectural building style that dominated office
            buildings, apartments, and towers during the cold war era. Two
            examples are below. The first image shows St. Joseph Medical Center
            in Tacoma, Washington, and is my favorite example of brutalist
            design. Built in the early 70's, designed and beautifully
            photographed by Bertrand Goldberg Associates, the building was an
            initiative to modernize healthcare.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="indented-paragraph">
          <p>
            The second image shows the New York City Police Headquarters in New
            York City. This is a good example of most buildings udner this
            style. It is boxy, very industrial, and meant to efficiently use as
            much space as possible. It's interesting to look at these buildings
            as its almost like a historical artifact, giving us a lens to peer
            into what life was like during the time.
