            Just yesterday my beloved Blackstar Mini Amplifier was blown to
            bits. I accidentally sat on it :cry:

            On a more serious note, (haha) I had this amp for only a few months.
            This was the amp that came home with me along with my first electric
            guitar. Both were bought in July of this year so, obviously, I've
            been having one hell of a time using it. It's another one of those
            little objects that I find so valuable in itself, that I made
            another mock-up coffin as a memorial to it.

        <h2 class="indented-paragraph">What is Brutalism?</h2>

        <div class="text-and-image">
          <p class="indented-paragraph">
            Brutalism is an architectural building style that dominated office
            buildings, apartments, and towers during the cold war era. Two
            examples are below. The first image shows St. Joseph Medical Center
            in Tacoma, Washington, and is my favorite example of brutalist
            design. Built in the early 70's, designed and beautifully
            photographed by Bertrand Goldberg Associates, the building was an
            initiative to modernize healthcare.

        <div class="indented-paragraph">
          <p>
            The second image shows the New York City Police Headquarters in New
            York City. This is a good example of most buildings udner this
            style. It is boxy, very industrial, and meant to efficiently use as
            much space as possible. It's interesting to look at these buildings
            as its almost like a historical artifact, giving us a lens to peer
            into what life was like during the time.
